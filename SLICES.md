# The Rules
1. Deal 2 cards, face up, to every player (1 player in our case)
  a. If the player has been dealt 'blackjack' (AT), then the player wins
2. Deal the dealer 2 cards
  a. The first card is face up
  b. The second card is face down
3. The player then decides to 'hit' or 'stand'
  a. If the player 'hits', deal them a card, face up
    i. If the total of the players cards are 21 or higher, then they must 'stand'
  b. If the player 'stands', then it is now the dealer's turn
4. The dealer then turns their 'hole' card face up
5. The dealer then 'hits' until the total of the dealers cards are 17 or higher
  a. If the total of the dealers cards are 17 or higher, then they must 'stand'
6. We then decide who wins
  a. If the player's cards are <= 21
    i. If the dealer's cards are equal, the player gets their original bet back
    ii. If the dealer's cards are less, or the dealer's hand is > 21, then the player gets double their bet
